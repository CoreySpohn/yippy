"""Performance quantities against a package whose answers are known in closed form.

Every assertion here computes its expected value from the constants in
``tests/synthetic_yip.py`` and elementary functions, never by calling the
reader's own conversion or by re-typing its implementation. A shipped package
cannot support tests like these: its correct answers are not known
independently of the code that produces them, so a test against one can only
pin current behavior.

The remaining aperture bias is midpoint intensity quadrature over fractional
boundary cells. An independent circle-square quadrature of the analytic
Gaussian predicts this small bias without calling the production integrator.
