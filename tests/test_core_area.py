"""The core area and throughput are those of the PSF the image simulator renders.

With a PSF truncation ratio ``r`` the core of an off-axis PSF is the region
where its intensity exceeds ``r`` times its peak. ``Coronagraph.core_area`` is
the solid angle of that region in (lambda/D)^2, the photometric aperture an
exposure-time calculator multiplies the leaked starlight and the background by,
and ``Coronagraph.throughput`` is the fraction of the source's light inside it,
which sets the planet count rate. At every separation, on or between the
tabulated offsets, the default curves interpolate the measurements of the
package PSFs. Explicit separation steps opt into synthesized-PSF measurements.

The references here do not come from the code under test. A circular Gaussian
of standard deviation sigma and flux F has the core area
``2 pi sigma^2 ln(1 / r)`` and the core throughput ``F (1 - r)``. Between
two tabulated offsets yippy synthesizes the PSF as the two neighboring PSFs
shifted onto the source and mixed with weights linear in separation; for
concentric Gaussians that mixture is radially symmetric and its core radius is
the root of a one-dimensional equation. On a shipped package the reference is
the synthesized PSF's band-limited reconstruction, thresholded over the whole
image.
