These are the assertions that can only be made against real data: the header
keywords a package is required to carry, the normalization its PSFs are written
with, and the working angles the reader derives from them. They are data-gated.
A cold cache with no network skips with a reason naming the cause, setting
``YIPPY_REQUIRE_REFERENCE_DATA=1`` turns that skip into a failure, and a cache
that is present and disagrees fails either way.

Numbers pinned here are measured properties of the shipped package rather than

move. Where a quantity has a closed form it is tested against the synthetic
package instead, in ``test_analytic_yip.py``.
