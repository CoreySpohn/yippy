"""The transformations a caller is entitled to apply to a coronagraph.

``Coronagraph`` is the loader: it holds scipy interpolants and is evaluated
eagerly. ``EqxCoronagraph`` is the array-only view a consumer calls from inside
``jit``, ``vmap`` or ``grad``, and it is the object these transformation tests
target. Synthesis through ``Coronagraph.offax`` is already JAX-backed, so the
batching tests use it directly.

Consumers call these methods from inside ``jit``, from inside ``vmap``, and
through ``grad``. Each transformation is a separate code path in JAX, so
agreement between them is a property that has to be asserted rather than
assumed: a traced argument that silently takes a Python branch, or a batched
call that reuses one element's index, produces a wrong answer with no error.

Every expected value here is another evaluation of the same quantity under a
different transformation, which makes these consistency properties rather than
physics. The physics is checked in ``test_analytic_yip.py`` against closed
forms.
