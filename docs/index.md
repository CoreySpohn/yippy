# Welcome to yippy Documentation

`yippy` is a package designed to read a "Yield Input Package" (YIP) in Python and generate the off-axis PSFs, stellar intensity maps, and sky transmission maps.

## Performance API

The performance functions imported in these examples are supported public API
and are also exported from `yippy`. They include `compute_truncation_curves`,
`truncation_core`, and `circular_aperture`. Names beginning with `_` are
implementation details, even when an example uses them to display intermediate
samples.

For photometry on an arbitrary image at a known centroid, pass an explicit
`fixed_center=(row, column)` in original pixel coordinates:

```python
from yippy import circular_aperture

flux, area, _ = circular_aperture(
    image, radius_pix=2.8, pixel_scale_lod=0.25,
    fixed_center=(32.2, 31.7),
)
```

This center takes precedence over `nominal_center` and performs no peak search.
The window must contain the aperture, and image edges clip both flux and area.
