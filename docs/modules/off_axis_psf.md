# Off-Axis PSF Files Documentation
## Introduction
This documentation provides detailed information about the off-axis Point Spread Function (PSF) files used in the `yippy` package, designed for working with coronagraph simulations. The off-axis PSF maps are crucial for understanding the optical system's response to light sources that are not aligned with the optical axis, typically representing exoplanets or other celestial bodies in astrophysical observations.

## File Description
The `offax_psf.fits` file contains a 3D array of off-axis PSF maps. These maps are indexed by two spatial coordinates (x, y) and a third index representing different astrophysical offsets (from the `offax_psf_offset_list.fits` file). These offsets correspond to the position of a point source, measured in units of λ/D, where λ is the wavelength of observation and D is the diameter of the telescope's primary mirror.
### File Components
- Offset Dimension: Each slice along this dimension corresponds to a PSF shifted by a specific astrophysical offset, facilitating the simulation of various positions of celestial bodies.
- Spatial Dimensions (x, y): Represents the 2D PSF as pixels.

The `offax_psf_offset_list.fits` file accompanies the PSF maps, providing a 2xN_offsets array that lists the (x, y) values for each offset in the same units.
## Usage Tutorial
### With `yippy`
```python
from yippy import Coronagraph

coro = Coronagraph("path/to/yield/input/package")
psf = coro.offax(x, y)
```
